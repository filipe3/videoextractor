# Video Frame Extractor

This project aims to develop tools to help fast iterate over video files and manipulate frames

Specially to use ML and DNN tools to infere and train data.

## Getting Started

To extract the frames simply use the python command below:

```
Give examples
python extract.py --input "VIDEO_PATH" --output "FOLDER_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_SAVE_THE_FRAMES" --rate 15
```

--rate parameter is to define how many frames you want to skip before capture/save. The default rate is equals to 1.
